# What do I do?

I am software developer, engineer and solutions architect. For over twenty years I have been helping to solve problems using the achievements of Information and communication technologies. I mainly focus on Frontend solutions, because they determine the success of the prepared solution. At the same time, I do not limit myself to any language or platform and always choose the right tools for the issue ‚ö°

I am a researcher and passionate about science and technology. I love puzzles and challenges. A faithful follower of the TQM and Lean philosophy. Agile practitioner and Software Craftmanship challenger. Saying "this can't be done" acts as a creativity trigger for me üïµÔ∏è

I love sharing knowledge and experience. I do this by being a mentor, speaker, trainer and consultant.

# RxJS Snippet for conference :) 

```typescript
export class BookEffects {
  search$: Observable<Action> = this.actions$.pipe(
    ofType(ActionTypes.SEARCH),
    debounceTime(300),
    map(toPayload),
    switchMap(query => {
      if (query === '') { return empty(); }

      const nextSearch$ = this.actions$.ofType(book.ActionTypes.SEARCH)
        .pipe(skip(1));

      return this.googleBooks.searchBooks(query).pipe(
        takeUntil(nextSearch$),
        map(books => new book.SearchCompleteAction(books)),
        catch(() => of(new book.SearchCompleteAction([]))));
    });

    constructor(private actions$: Actions, 
      private googleBooks: GoogleBooksService) { }
}
```
